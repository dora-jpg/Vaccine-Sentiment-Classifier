# Vaccine-Sentiment-Classifier

## Dataset
This dataset contains tweets about vaccines that are labeled 0 for neutral, 1 for anti-vax or 2 for pro-vax. In this repository I have developed vaccine sentiment classifiers using different models.

## Models
### Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression)
### Feed Forward Neural Networks
### Bidirectional Recursive Neural Networks
### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers)
